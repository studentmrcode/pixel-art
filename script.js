// Section 1: Make a single variable for all of the squares.
// You can name it anything you want, but since it represents multiple squares, the name should be plural, like squares.


// Section 2: Make a variable for the button.
// You can name it anything you want, but for simplicity, name it the same as the ID.


// Section 3: Add separate event listeners to the squares and button.
// You can name the functions anything you want, but pick something that indicates action.


// Section 4: Make separate functions to toggle a square and clear the grid.
